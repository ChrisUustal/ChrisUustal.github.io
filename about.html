            <!-- <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hey! My name's Chris, and I like making prototypes of cool things that solve unqiue problems.</p>
            <p>I'm from Morristown, NJ and I'm currently living in Evanston, IL while attending Northwestern University. 
                I have two adorable dogs at home named Rosie and Darlie, and I enjoy rock climbing and hiking in my free time when I'm not working on one of my engineering hobby projects.</p>
            <p>I'm excited to announce that, following a successful internship at Tesla this past summer as a Systems Integration Engineer, I'll be returning back to Palo Alto full time next summer!</p> -->

            <h1>What</h1>
            <p>As am embedded engineer, I develop hardware and software that work together to solve real problems.</p>
            <p>I design solutions anywhere in the product life cycle from exploratory research and prototypes up to production designs being delivered to consumers.</p>
            <p>Working at the HW/SW interface, I have experience with the entire development stack from chip layout to firmware to front-end UI and everything in between.</p>

            <h1>Where</h1>
            <p>Currently located in Evanston, IL</p>
            <p>Relocating to Palo Alto, California in Summer of 2023</p>

            <h1>When</h1>
            <p>Currently not searching for employment, but if you're interested in connecting with me, feel free to reach out any time! I'm more than happy to help connect people with resources or whatever I can do to improve the lives of you engineers.</p>
        
            <h1>Why</h1>
            <h2><s>Magic</s> Engineering</h2>
            <p>When I was young, computers were magic boxes that let me play videogames. Now, I’m a magician.</p>
            <p>Engineering is about solving human problems, and I believe helping as many people as possible is a shared duty we all bare.</p>
            <p>We live in a world where yesterdays impossible becomes today’s reality every day. No dream is too high. No goal is out of reach. Together, we can make magic happen.</p>
